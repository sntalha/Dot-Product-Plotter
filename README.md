# Dot-Product-Calculator
This is a simple Python application built using Tkinter and Matplotlib to calculate and visualize the dot product of two 3D vectors. The user inputs two vectors, and the program calculates their dot product, displaying the result both numerically and graphically. The graphical output includes a 3D plot that visualizes the vectors and highlights the dot product on the x-axis. It was a university assignemt where I gained an insight on the Matplotlib library.
